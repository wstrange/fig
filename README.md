# Fig - Firebase Identity for Flutter using gRPC

Fig provides two packages:

* fig_auth - for Dart server code. Implements authentication for your gRPC services.
* fig_flutter - client authentication to your gRPC dart server code

Both packages delegate authentication to Firebase. This package provides a framework
for integrating authenticatin into gRPC services. 

Use this if:
* You want to use gRPC for your Dart server code (instead of http/json)
* You want your Flutter client to call your Dart service using gRPC


## Todo

* Lots...
